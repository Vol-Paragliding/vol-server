# Running this code

The directory `server` contains a minimal integration server implementation to get the backend started.

This is what you need to do to get started:

- Obtain your API credentials.
- Clone this repository
- Copy the `.env.sample` file to `.env`: `cp .env.sample` `.env`
- Paste your service credentials into the `.env` file
- Move to the `server` directory and install the dependencies by running `yarn install` or `npm install`.
- Run the server from the `server` directory with `yarn start`/`npm run start`.
